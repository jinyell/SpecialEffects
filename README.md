# SpecialEffects

## Overview
This is an AR effect using the front camera. It is developed using Unity and AR Core. This app is being made and tested for Android devices.

My favorite part of watching tv growing up was watching cartoons. Every Saturday morning I would wake up early to watch shows such as Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry. When watching these shows one of my favorite part was the over exaggerated facial expressions. I especially loved it when steam started coming out of their ears. This AR effect emulates steam exploding ears.

## Functionality
Users can swipe left or right to have steam come out of their ears or nostrils. There are currently 2 steamy ear effects and 1 nostril effect. The player can also swipe up and down in order to switch the emoji. The face gradually turns red and then returns to normal.
